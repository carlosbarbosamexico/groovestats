GrooveStats: A google analytics tracking js clone

GrooveStats is a simple js that collects data from your visitors browser and send it to some endpoint.

The Data tracked is pretty much what Google Analytics track.

To implement:

Create your endpoint in the server script language of your choice.
Set the endpoint in GrooveStat
Include GrooveStat in your pages
That's it, now your endpoint should receive data async.
