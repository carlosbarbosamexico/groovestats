Groovestats: A google analytics tracking js clone

Groovestats is a simple js that collects data from your visitors browser and send it to some endpoint.

The data tracked is pretty much what Google Analytics track.

To implement:

* Create your endpoint in the server script language of your choice.
* Set the endpoint in GrooveStat
* Include GrooveStat in your pages
* That's it, now your endpoint should receive data async.
